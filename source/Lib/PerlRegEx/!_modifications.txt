- search for IFDEF/IFNDEF PEPAK (changes I will want in all my programs)
  and IFDEF/IFNDEF PEPAK_YTD (changes specific to YouTube Downloader)
- compatibility with Delphi 5 (using jedi.inc rather than standard IFDEFs)
- use statically linked PCRE (no pcre.dll dependency)
- change constant MAX_SUBEXPRESSIONS to 1024 (IMPORTANT!!!)
- added a non-unicode version of object files for Delphi prior to 2009
